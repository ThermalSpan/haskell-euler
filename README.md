Project Euler Solutions In Haskell
==================================

My solutions to project euler problems, written in Haskell. Not to many at the moment. 

#Operation
Once the repository is downloaded, you should be able to use as follows. 
```bash
cabal run {Problem Number}
```

Example for solving problem 1:

```bash
$ cabal run 1
Preprocessing executable 'projecteuler' for projecteuler-0.1.0.0...

```

#Background
I started this when I was fairly new to Haskell. I was searching for a small project where I could start using cabal, and actually build a larger haskell application with modules and stuff. While looking around, I found Guillaume Nargeot's repository <a href="https://github.com/guillaume-nargeot/project-euler-haskell">here</a>. I thought that was pretty great, and it helped ease into cabal. 

I'm trying to follow best practices, but I have quite a bit to learn to we'll see how it goes.
